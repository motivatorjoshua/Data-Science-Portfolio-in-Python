        "Example:- Suppose, we want to predict, whether the Girls Student will play cricket or not (refer below data set). Here you need to identify predictor variables, target variable, data type of variables and category of variables.\n",

        "**Continuous Variables:**- In case of continuous variables, we need to understand the central tendency and spread of the variable. These are measured using various statistical metrics visualization methods as shown below:\n",

        "**Categorical Variables:-** For categorical variables, we’ll use frequency table to understand distribution of each category. We can also read as percentage of values under each category. It can be be measured using two metrics, Count and Count% against each category. Bar chart can be used as visualization.\n",
